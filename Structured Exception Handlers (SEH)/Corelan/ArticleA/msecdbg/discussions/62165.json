    "Html": "<p>Hi Jim,</p>\r\n<p>The /GS stack protection is considered defense in depth. It is bad practice to depend on defense in depth mechanisms, because that removes the &quot;in depth&quot;. Compile them in, turn them on, but don't allow their existence to be used as a rationale for leaving vulnerable code in place.</p>\r\n<p>To&nbsp;use an analogy, the fact that I have airbags in my car does not mean I shouldn't worry about the fact that my brakes don't work.</p>\r\n<p>In the case of a /GS violation, we know that there is an unconstrained (or improperly constrained) copy onto the stack. If the state of the art is such that an attacker is able to evade the version of /GS that the application was compiled against, then the attacker has the ability to get remote execution of code.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; --Dave</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
