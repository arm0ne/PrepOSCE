I downloaded the most recent version of the MSECExtensions (1.6.0 as of today), unzipped it, and copied the dll and pdb files from x64\\Release into my WinDbg's winext directory.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I launch windbg and attempt to load MSEC, this is my output:\r<br />\n<br />\n0:000&gt; !load winext/MSEC.dll\r<br />\nThe call to LoadLibrary(winext/MSEC.dll) failed, Win32 error 0n126<br />\n<pre><code>&quot;The specified module could not be found.&quot;</code></pre>\n\nPlease check your debugger configuration and/or network access.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've seen some previous posts about this that said, &quot;Read the readme in the MSEC directory&quot;. Unfortunately there is no readme in the latest release, just a license file and a changelog.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny pointers to getting msec up and running on an x64 system (such as prereqs) would be mucho appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nReid<br />\n",
