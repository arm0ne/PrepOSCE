<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />&#33;exploitable &#40;pronounced &#8220;bang exploitable&#8221;&#41;  is a Windows  debugging  extension &#40;Windbg&#41; that provides automated crash analysis and security risk assessment.    The tool first creates hashes to determine the uniqueness of a crash and then assigns an exploitability rating to the crash: Exploitable, Probably Exploitable, Probably Not Exploitable, or Unknown.  There is more detailed information about the tool in the following .pptx file or at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/msec">http://www.microsoft.com/security/msec</a>.  Additonally, see the blog post at <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/04/08/the-history-of-the-exploitable-crash-analyzer.aspx">http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/04/08/the-history-of-the-exploitable-crash-analyzer.aspx</a>, or watch the video at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/PDCNews/Bang-Exploitable-Security-Analyzer/">http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/PDCNews/Bang-Exploitable-Security-Analyzer/</a>.<br /><br />This tool was created by the Microsoft Security Engineering Center (MSEC) Security Science Team.
